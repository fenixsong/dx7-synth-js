DXperiment7 Synth
=================

![](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/yamaha-dx-7.jpg)

DXperiment7 FM synthesis using the Web Audio and Web MIDI API. Works in Chrome and Firefox.
Use a MIDI or QWERTY keyboard to play the synth. Trying new algorithms and maybe more. (Subtractive post Osc processing?!?!)
